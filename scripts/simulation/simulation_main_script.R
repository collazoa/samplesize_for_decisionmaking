# Approach A:
# Replication study powered for the effect size obtained 
# in the original study at 80% and 95% respectively

source("./scripts/simulation/sim_approach_a.R")

# Approach B:
# Replication study powered at 50% for the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI)
# SESOI 1 = 0.5 (for orig. effect size 0.5-1.5)
# SESOI 2 = 1.5 (for orig. effect size 1.5-2.5)
# SESOI 3 = 2.5 (for orig. effect size > 2.5)

source("./scripts/simulation/sim_approach_b.R")

# Approach C:
# Replication study powered at 80% for the lower 80% confidence bound 
# obtained from the original study

# source("./scripts/simulation/sim_approach_c.R")

# Approach D:
# Replication study powered for reverse Bayesian approach (skeptical p-value)
# with an effect size shrinkage estimate of 25%  

# source("./scripts/simulation/sim_approach_d.R")


# combining data sets and plotting results
