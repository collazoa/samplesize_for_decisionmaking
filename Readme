For the descriptive analysis and as a basis for our simulation study, we used data from three preclinical replication projects: the Brasilian Reproducibility Initiative (BRI), the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RPCB) and the Preclinical Confirmatory Studies (CPS) (add reference to project description). 

Access to data of the original experiments was derived from direct contact with the research groups (CPS), and from public data repositories (RPCB, BRI) (Supplement)
